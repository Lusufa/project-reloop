## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#84A98C) to reflect the eco-friendly nature of the app.
- Background color: Light beige (#F8F9FA), a very desaturated tint of the primary green, creates a clean and natural backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#D58936) to highlight important actions and information. This choice, which lands to the 'left' of green on the color wheel, still vibes with the earth-friendly inspiration, like autumn leaves.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' sans-serif for headlines, providing a sense of art and design; body font: 'Alegreya' serif for body, suitable for readability in longer text.
- Use eco-friendly themed icons (leaves, recycling symbols, etc.)
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on visual storytelling through images of upcycled products.
- Modern animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback, without distracting from the user experience.
